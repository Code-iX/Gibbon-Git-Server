title: Roadmap
---

This section outlines the planned features and improvements for Gibbon Git Server. Our goal is to continuously enhance functionality and user experience. Below are some of the key areas we are exploring:

- **Post-Commit Action Plugins**: Implement a plugin system for executing actions after a commit, giving users greater control and automation options.
- **Scheduled Action Plugins**: Add support for plugins that enable scheduled tasks, such as automated backups, repository maintenance, or notifications.
- **UI Search**: Introduce advanced search functionality within the user interface, helping users quickly find repositories, commits, or other information.
- **Graphical Branch View**: Develop a visual representation of branches, making it easier to navigate and understand repository structure and history.
- **User Role Management Enhancements**: Improve role-based access control (RBAC) by allowing admins to define custom roles and permissions beyond the current set of predefined roles.
- **Repository Webhooks**: Add support for repository-specific webhooks, enabling automatic integration with third-party services like CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) for more seamless workflows.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security by integrating two-factor authentication (2FA) for user accounts, adding an additional layer of protection for sensitive repositories.
- **Push/Audit Logging and Analytics**: Implement comprehensive logging and analytics for all push operations, including who pushed, when, and what was pushed, providing better insight into repository activities.
- **Repository Forking and Pull Requests**: Introduce forking functionality, allowing users to create forks of repositories and propose changes through pull requests directly in the UI.
- **Improved Repository Permissions**: Expand repository permissions management, allowing for more granular control, such as read-only vs. write access for specific branches or users.
- **Backup and Restore Features**: Add built-in tools for backing up repositories and configurations, as well as options for easy restoration in case of server failures or corruption.
- **Dark Mode UI**: Implement a dark mode option for the user interface to improve accessibility and reduce eye strain, especially during long sessions.
- **REST API Expansion**: Extend the current REST API to provide more endpoints, allowing developers to automate repository management, user creation, and permission assignments programmatically.
- **File History and Diff Viewer**: Develop a built-in file history and diff viewer, allowing users to track changes to specific files over time and compare different versions visually.
