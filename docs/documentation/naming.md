The name **Gibbon Git Server** was chosen to honor the legacy of **Bonobo Git Server** while representing a new direction focused on agility and simplicity. Gibbons, like bonobos, are highly intelligent and adaptable primates, but their speed and efficiency in movement through the trees symbolize the streamlined and responsive nature of this project.

### Honoring Bonobo Git Server:
- **Building on a solid foundation**: Gibbon Git Server acknowledges the contributions and stability of the Bonobo Git Server. By evolving from it, we aim to preserve its strengths while refining certain areas to better fit modern needs.
  
### Why "Gibbon"?
- **Agility**: Gibbons are known for their fast, efficient movementsâ€”qualities reflected in Gibbon Git Server's lightweight design and performance.
- **Simplicity**: Just as gibbons move gracefully through complex environments, this project seeks to simplify management and deployment without compromising power.
- **Adaptability**: Gibbons thrive in varied environments, and this server is built to be flexible and capable in a wide range of use cases.

With **Gibbon Git Server**, we aim to maintain the balance between honoring the past and embracing a more agile, future-focused approach, while still retaining the ease of use that Bonobo Git Server users have come to appreciate.
