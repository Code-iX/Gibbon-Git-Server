title: Authentication
---
Gibbon Git Server currently supports **Cookie Authentication**, providing a simple and familiar login experience for users. This method uses an authentication cookie to maintain session persistence after the user has successfully logged in via a username and password form.

### 1. Cookie Authentication

Cookie Authentication allows users to log in using a web form where they provide their username and password. Once authenticated, the server creates a secure cookie that validates the user's identity for subsequent requests, eliminating the need to re-enter credentials.

#### How to Configure Cookie Authentication

To enable Cookie Authentication in Gibbon Git Server, you'll need to adjust the configuration in `appsettings.json`. Unlike the previous **Bonobo Git Server** setup, Gibbon no longer uses `web.config`. Instead, you can configure authentication directly in `appsettings.json`.

Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file located in the root of the published application.
2. Find the **Authentication** section and ensure the following settings are configured for Cookie Authentication:

   ```json
   {
     "Authentication": {
       "DefaultScheme": "Cookies",
       "Schemes": {
         "Cookies": {
           "LoginPath": "/Account/Login",
           "LogoutPath": "/Account/Logout",
           "ExpireTimeSpan": "00:30:00",  // Adjust the session expiration time if needed
           "SlidingExpiration": true       // Optional: extend session if user is active
         }
       }
     }
   }
```

3. Save the file and restart the application.

#### Security Considerations

Since **Git** communicates with the server using the **Basic Authentication** protocol, user credentials are sent with each request. To ensure security, it's recommended to enable **SSL** (HTTPS) in your IIS or Kestrel server to encrypt the communication.

##### Enabling SSL (HTTPS) in IIS

1. Obtain an SSL certificate for your server.
2. In **IIS Manager**, select your website, then click on **Bindings**.
3. Add a new binding for **https** and select your SSL certificate.
4. Restart your site.

Once SSL is enabled, your application will enforce secure communication, protecting user credentials during transmission.

This authentication mechanism is simple, secure (when combined with HTTPS), and well-suited for most environments. For more advanced authentication methods, stay tuned for future updates in Gibbon Git Server's feature set.
