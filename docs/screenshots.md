This section outlines the planned features and improvements for Gibbon Git Server. Our goal is to continuously enhance functionality and user experience. Below are the key areas we are focusing on for future updates:

- **Post-Commit Action Plugins**: A plugin system to enable actions after a commit, giving users more control and automation options for tasks like notifications or updates.
  
- **Scheduled Action Plugins**: Support for scheduled tasks, such as automated backups, repository maintenance, or email notifications, allowing for more comprehensive automation.

- **UI Search**: Advanced search functionality within the interface, allowing users to quickly find repositories, commits, users, or other key data.

- **Graphical Branch View**: A visual representation of branches to simplify navigation and understanding of repository structure and history.

- **User Role Management Enhancements**: Improve role-based access control (RBAC) by allowing administrators to define custom roles and permissions, expanding beyond the current predefined roles.

- **Repository Webhooks**: Support for repository-specific webhooks to enable automatic integration with third-party services (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI), streamlining CI/CD workflows.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Strengthen security by integrating 2FA for user accounts, adding an additional layer of protection for accessing sensitive repositories.

- **Push/Audit Logging and Analytics**: Comprehensive logging for all push operations, tracking who pushed, when, and what was pushed, along with analytics for better insight into repository activities.

- **Repository Forking and Pull Requests**: Implement forking functionality, allowing users to create forks of repositories and submit pull requests directly in the UI to propose changes.

- **Improved Repository Permissions**: Granular control over repository permissions, such as setting read-only vs. write access for specific branches or individual users.

- **Backup and Restore Features**: Built-in tools for backing up repositories and configurations, along with easy restoration options in case of server failures or corruption.

- **Dark Mode UI**: A dark mode option for the user interface to improve accessibility and reduce eye strain, especially during long work sessions.

- **REST API Expansion**: Expanding the REST API to provide more endpoints, allowing for automation of repository management, user creation, and permission settings via API.

- **File History and Diff Viewer**: A built-in file history and diff viewer to track changes to specific files over time and visually compare different versions for easier code review and management.
