[![GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Code-iX/Gibbon-Git-Server/actions/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Code-iX/Gibbon-Git-Server/actions/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml)

**Gibbon Git Server** is a self-hosted Git server built with **ASP.NET Core**. This fork is currently under heavy development, and branch squashing will occur soon. Feel free to explore, but please refrain from forking for development purposes at this time.

For further information and documentation, please visit the [official website](https://code-ix.github.io/Gibbon-Git-Server/).

This is a fork of the original [Bonobo Git Server](https://github.com/jakubgarfield/Bonobo-Git-Server), which was last 
updated in 2019. The original project was built on .NET Framework, which is now outdated. This fork aims to modernize 
the project by migrating it to ASP.NET Core 8.0. The goal is to provide a more efficient, secure, and cross-platform Git 
server solution. You can find the key changes [below](#key-changes-to-bonobo-git-server).
